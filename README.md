InstaSearch
===========

InstaSearch is a basic Trie-based instant search program that searches a provided word dictionary. This is primarily a proof of concept. I hope to make this available as a easy-to-use library when I get some more time on my hands.

How to Run
==========

You can download the jar file from the home directory "InstantAutoComplete.jar"
You can run it using the command "java -jar -d32 -XstartOnFirstThread InstantAutoComplete.jar"

Alternatively, you can specify a dictionary file as "java -jar -d32 -XstartOnFirstThread InstantAutoComplete.jar dictionary.txt"
You can find some sample dictionaries in ./src/autoComplete/
